Once upon a time, there was a young man named Hans. Hans lived in a small secluded shack deep inside a forest. He enjoyed a simple, contented life, isolated from the stresses of ordinary life.
Sometimes, however, Hans did wonder what it was like to be around other people. One day, his curiosity burgeoned to the point where he felt compelled to do something about it...
Hans decided to pack his things and head north to find out what was in the wide world. However, the journey would prove more dangerous than Hans first thought. Along his
travels he encountered hunger, wild beasts, and thieves. After days of walking, Hans finally arrived at a large city...
Excited to meet people, he went to the tavern for a drink. He drank and talked with people and had a merry time all night. Exhausted, he got a room to sleep in at the tavern and went to bed feeling satisfied...

A long journey had come to a happy conclusion. Hans knew now that while the world had much to offer, it didn't reflect the same comfortable simplicity and securit he had been previously accustomed to. 
Accordingly, he decided to go back home the next day, traversing back along the same route, still with a slight sense of wonder but now also an assuredness in his assessment of the world. Nontheless,
he was grateful for the experiences that he'd had, and the people he'd met along the way.
